        <h3>How to Play</h3>
        <p>Ultimate (normal "Frisbee" is dropped due to it being copyrighted) is 7 aside outdoor sport. The aim of the game is to pass the disc from person to person and into the end zone while the other team is on defence. The match starts off with a pull, this is where you throw the disc to other team. When you are holding the disc you are not aloud to move. You are aloud use one foot as a pivot foot to step around the defender marking you. If a pass is incomplete then the other team gets the disc. When one team scores the other team goes to the opposite end and the team that scored throws the disc back to them to restart the match.</p>
        <h3>Rules</h3>
    
    <p>Travelling - Any movement of your pivot foot while attempting a throw is considered a foul, if called the disc is given to other team.</p>
    <p>Contact - Ultimate is strictly a non-contact sport, therefore contact should be kept to a minimum</p>
    <p>Counted Out - While attempting to get off a throw your defender will be counting to 10. If they reach 10 and you haven't throw the disc, the other team gets the disc</p>
    <p>Fast Count - If your count is considered too fast you can call a fast count where you have to slow down your count</p>
    <p>Double Marking - If 2 people or more are marking the same man that is a foul.</p>
    
    
    <h3>Current Personal Progress</h3>
    <p>I have currently competed in 2 competitions, Trinity Tea Party (Finishing 2nd) & Developmental IV's (Finishing 4th). We have been training for 8 months and are currently looking forward to the next Developmental IV's where we hope to improve on our last position. We believe that with great training and focus we can build upon all our previous experience and push for a trophy in the near future. </p>
