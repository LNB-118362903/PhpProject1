        <h2>Trip to London</h2>
    </center>
        <p>The trip I made to London last year was my first ever journey to the UK. From a man which the biggest city had been pervious was Dublin it was guaranteed to be quite the experience.</p>

        <h3>London Eye</h3>
    </center>
        <p>One of my first tourist attractions I visited was the London Eye. While going around it I had a perfect view of Ben Big and the rest of the entire city. At 443 feet high, the London Eye is currently the fourth-largest Ferris wheel in the world. A ride on the London Eye takes 30 minutes, and it travels at a speed of about 0.6 miles per hour. With more than 3.5 million people checking out the Eye every year, it's now the most popular paid tourist attraction in the U.K. The Eye has 32 capsules (one for each of the city's 32 boroughs), but they're numbered from one to 33. Why? As with many buildings and other structures, there is no No. 13 capsule—whether the superstition about that number is warranted or not, the cars skip from 12 to 14. The entire wheel weighs more than 1,000 tons, or well over 1 million pounds. It was assembled flat and moved onto eight temporary islands on the River Thames; the structure was raised into place in September 1999. But the process wasn't without its snafus: one of the cables in the structure snapped before it was lifted, and had to be replaced. More than 5,000 people have gotten engaged on the Eye since it opened, with both sedate proposals and orchestrated flash mobs among the celebrations. (If you want to do the same in a private capsule, it'll cost you £360—about $559—but champagne is included.) </p>

        <h3>Madame Tussauds</h3>
        </center>
        <p>While in the gallery I learned lots about it and saw many different amazing sculpture. It was founded by wax sculptor Anna Maria “Marie” Tussaud. Marie Tussaud was born as Marie Grosholtz in 1761 in Strasbourg, France. Her mother worked as a housekeeper for Dr. Philippe Curtius in Bern, Switzerland, who was a physician skilled in wax modelling. Curtius taught Tussaud the art of wax modelling. Young Marie’s first sculpture was Francois Voltaire. She made it at the tender age of 16. Tussaud was perceived as a royal sympathizer and during the French Revolution she was imprisoned for three months awaiting execution, but was released after the intervention of an influential friend. She inherited the doctor’s vast collection of wax models following his death in 1794, and spent the next 33 years travelling around Europe. By 1835, Marie had settled down in Baker Street, London and opened a museum. Ever since it first opened on 1835, Madame Tussauds has been leaving visitors excited and star struck with the wide array of A-list celebrities featured in the wax museum.</p>
